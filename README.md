# Eliza x Hyperfy Agent

This project wraps some plugin development of a Hyperfy client which lets Eliza connect to Hyperfy like a user. I will probably break out the Hyperfy portion into a plugin and publish that, but for now, here it is.

To run:

1. clone and run Hyperfy: https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy
2. Add the ENV variables from Hyperfy to the agent
3. Run the project with `npm run dev`, `bun run dev` or your favorite package manager
